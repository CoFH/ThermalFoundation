For every level, it increases capacity by 50%, up to +200% at Holding IV. This stacks with other things that modify storage capacity, such as $(l:thermal:technology/augments/introduction)augments$(/l). For example, if a machine has $(l:thermal:technology/augments/integral_components)resonant integral components$(/l) and holding IV, it will store 12x the RF."    }  ]}
