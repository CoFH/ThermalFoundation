They have a coil side, which is indicated by the large red nub that glows when the dynamo is generating. RF is output from the coil side only, and fuel is accepted from any of the other sides. Without any upgrades, dynamos produce up to 40 RF/t."    },    {      "type": "text",      "text": "Dynamos have an internal buffer which can be upgraded using $(l:thermal:technology/augments/integral_components)integral components$(/l) but not RF coil augments. Dynamos will automatically throttle their RF output and fuel usage based on how full this buffer is. When empty, dynamos will work at their maximum RF output. When full, dynamos will work at 10% output, using fuel even though the RF generated is wasted. The buffer will only automatically output when the dynamo is generating, and will gradually decay when idle."    }  ]}
