I thought not. It's not a story the CoFH wiki would tell you. It's a Discord legend. Darth Lemming was a Dark Lord of Java, so powerful and so wise he could use the Code to influence the other modders to fix bugs... He had such a knowledge of Java that he could even keep the mods he cared about from dying."    },    {      "type": "text",      "text": "The dark side of Java is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing RF balance, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught other modders everything he knew, then these modders scaled RF usage a thousandfold. It's ironic he could save other mods from being underpowered, but not his own."    }  ]}
