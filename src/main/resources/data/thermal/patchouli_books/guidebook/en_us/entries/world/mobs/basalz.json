It spawns 8 orbiting projectiles that hit anything unfortunate enough to get within 4 blocks. Each hit consumes one projectile. Once all projectiles are consumed, the basalz retreats and takes 5 seconds to recharge 8 more projectiles."    },    {      "type": "text",      "title": "Strategy",      "text": "The easiest way to deal with the basalz is with a ranged weapon. In melee situations, even armored players may have difficulty tanking all 8 projectiles because they apply Sundered. It is best to use a shield to absorb the impact of all 8 projectiles, then attack the basalz while it's vulnerable. Alternatively, leading the basalz to other mobs will let them take the damage."    }  ]}
